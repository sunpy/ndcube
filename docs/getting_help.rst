Getting Help
============

If you are unsure of the general features of the ndcube package, your
first stop should be this guide which we strive to make as
comprehensive, yet understandable, as possible.  If you would like to
know more about how to use a specific function, class, etc.,
documentation for each object is stored in the source code itself.  It
can be accessed there or in the :ref:`api` of this guide. If you
cannot find the answer to your issue there, would like to provide
feedback, or would like help contributing code to ndcube, you can get
help directly from the ndcube team in a number of ways.

SunPy Mailing Lists
-------------------

ndcube is a SunPy-affiliated package and is developed within the
larger SunPy development ecosystem.  You can contact the ndcube
developers by email via the SunPy mailing lists.  Just reference ndcube
in the email subject and it will find its way to a relevant developer.

SunPy has two mailing lists: a `general mailing list`_; and a
`developer mailing list`_. If you have a general question about how
ndcube works, use the general mailing list. The general mailing list is
another way to get help with doing solar physics in Python. If, on the
other hand, you have a question about the inner workings of ndcube,
how ndcube is organized, or have a question about developing some new
feature, please use the developer mailing list.

Live Chat
---------

SunPy has a `chat room`_ that uses `Matrix`_ which will open directly in
your browser. Stop by and say hello. Talk with the SunPy and ndcube
users and developers and get started.

If you are using IRC hosted on `freenode`_, then you can join the same
channel (bridged into matrix) by joining the (#sunpy) channel on
freenode.
