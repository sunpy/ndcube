To support compatibility with reproject 0.9, the API of `.NDCube.reproject_to`
has been tweaked so that any keyword argument to the underlying reprojection
function can be passed through. This has the effect of being a breaking change
if you were specifying any arguments after ``shape_out=`` as positional rather
than keyword arguments. (Note that in a future release we will probably change
to require keyword arguments to ``reproject_to``.
