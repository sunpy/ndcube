1.1 (Unreleased)
================

New Features
------------
- Added installation instructions to docs. [#77]

API Changes
-----------
- Replaced API of what was previously ``utils.wcs.get_dependent_axes``,
  with two new functions, ``utils.wcs.get_dependent_data_axes`` and
  ``utils.wcs.get_dependent_wcs_axes``. This was inspired by a new
  implementation in ``glue-viz`` which is intended to be merged into
  ``astropy`` in the future.  This API change helped fix the
  ``NDCube.world_axis_physical_type`` bug listed below. [#80]
- ``NDCube`` generates a False mask (all pixels unmasked) on
  instantiation if one is not provided by the user. [#89]

Bug Fixes
---------
- Fixed bugs in ``NDCubeSequence`` slicing and
  ``NDCubeSequence.dimensions`` in cases where sub-cubes contain
  scalar ``.data``. [#79]
- Fixed ``NDCube.world_axis_physical_types`` in cases where there is a
  ``missing`` WCS axis. [#80]
