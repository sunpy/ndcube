1.1 (Unreleased)
================

New Features
------------
- Created a new `~ndcube.NDCubeBase` which has all the functionality
  of `~ncube.NDCube` except the plotting.  The old ``NDCubeBase``
  which outlined the ``NDCube`` API was renamed ``NDCubeABC``.
  `~ndcube.NDCube` has all the same functionality as before except is
  now simply inherits from `~ndcube.NDCubeBase` and
  `~ndcube.mixins.plotting.NDCubePlotMixin`. [#101]
- Moved NDCubSequence plotting to a new mixin class,
  NDCubSequencePlotMixin, making the plotting an optional extra.  All
  the non-plotting functionality now lives in the NDCubeSequenceBase class. [#98]

API Changes
-----------
- Replaced API of what was previously ``utils.wcs.get_dependent_axes``,
  with two new functions, ``utils.wcs.get_dependent_data_axes`` and
  ``utils.wcs.get_dependent_wcs_axes``. This was inspired by a new
  implementation in ``glue-viz`` which is intended to be merged into
  ``astropy`` in the future.  This API change helped fix the
  ``NDCube.world_axis_physical_type`` bug listed below. [#80]
- Give users more control in plotting both for NDCubePlotMixin and
  NDCubeSequencePlotMixin.  In most cases the axes coordinates, axes
  units, and data unit can be supplied manually or via supplying the
  name of an extra coordinate if it is wanted to describe an
  axis. In the case of NDCube, the old API is currently still
  supported by will be removed in future versions. [#98 #103]

Bug Fixes
---------
- Allowed `~ndcube.NDCubeBase.axis_world_coords` to accept negative
  axis indices as arguments. [#106]
- Fixed bug in ``NDCube.crop_by_coords`` in case where real world
  coordinate system was rotated relative to pixel grid. [#113].


1.0.1
==================

New Features
------------
- Added installation instructions to docs. [#77]

Bug Fixes
---------
- Fixed bugs in ``NDCubeSequence`` slicing and
  ``NDCubeSequence.dimensions`` in cases where sub-cubes contain
  scalar ``.data``. [#79]
- Fixed ``NDCube.world_axis_physical_types`` in cases where there is a
  ``missing`` WCS axis. [#80]
- Fixed bugs in converting between negative data and WCS axis
  numbers. [#91]
- Add installation instruction to docs. [#77]
- Fix function name called within NDCubeSequence.plot animation update
  plot. [#95]
