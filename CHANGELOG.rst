1.0.1 (Unreleased)
==================

New Features
------------
- Added installation instructions to docs.

API Changes
-----------
- Replaced API of what was previously ``utils.wcs.get_dependent_axes``,
  with two new functions, ``utils.wcs.get_dependent_data_axes`` and
  ``utils.wcs.get_dependent_wcs_axes``. This was inspired by a new
  implementation in ``glue-viz`` which is intended to be merged into
  ``astropy`` in the future.  This API change helped fix the
  ``NDCube.world_axis_physical_type`` bug listed below.

Bug Fixes
---------
- Fixed bugs in ``NDCubeSequence`` slicing and
  ``NDCubeSequence.dimensions`` in cases where sub-cubes contain
  scalar ``.data``.
- Fixed ``NDCube.world_axis_physical_types`` in cases where there is a
  ``missing`` WCS axis.
