ndcube is an open-source SunPy affiliated package for manipulating, inspecting and visualizing multi-dimensional contiguous and non-contiguous coordinate-aware data arrays.

It combines data, uncertainties, units, metadata, masking, and coordinate transformations into classes with unified slicing and generic coordinate transformations and plotting/animation capabilities.
It is designed to handle data of any number of dimensions and axis types (e.g. spatial, temporal, spectral, etc.) whose relationship between the array elements and the real world can be described by World Coordinate System (WCS) translations.

Contributing
============

If you would like to get involved, check out the `Newcomers Guide`_ section of the SunPy docs.
This shows how to get setup with a "sunpy" workflow but the same applies for ndcube, you will just need to replace sunpy with ndcube.

Help is always welcome so let us know what you like to work on, or check out the `issues page`_ for the list of known outstanding items.
